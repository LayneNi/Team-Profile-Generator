# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This project was designed to dynamically create an HTML page for a team of employees by inputting information into various prompts. This application features a smooth and streamlined process for creating a team roster page to maximize efficiency, a user can quickly make the page with no prior knowledge of web development. In the process of creating this project I learned a lot about using classes in node.js as well as running tests and I improved my knowledge of using node.js to dynamically create a webpage.
